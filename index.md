These diagrams represent reconstructed Proto-Indo-European (called Indo-European in the diagrams) roots and their lines of descent ending in Modern English words. This is a work in progress, so stylistic details vary quite a bit between pages and some links may be dead. There will eventually be pages explaining how to read these charts and the history of the work, but right now there's none of that. This site is not screen-reader-friendly; most of the information is contained in image files, and I don't know how else to do it. If you somehow found this site on your own and have constructive feedback, send it to milliliter (at) protonmail (dot) com. 

Right now I have two navigation options:
<li><a href="root-list.html">alphabetical list of PIE roots</a></li>
<li><a href="alpha-index.html">alphabetical index of Modern English words</a></li>
<br/>
The diagrams were all made using <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> and the <a href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">DOT language</a>.

The idea for this project, and the beginnings of many of the pages, come from <i>Roots: Family Histories of Familiar Words</i> by Peter Davies (McGraw Hill, 1981).
My primary source is <i>The American Heritage College Dictionary</i> (Houghton Mifflin, 2004). More sources and more specific citations are in the works.
