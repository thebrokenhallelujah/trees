These diagrams represent reconstructed Proto-Indo-European (called Indo-European in the diagrams) roots and their lines of descent ending in Modern English words. This is a work in progress, so stylistic details vary quite a bit between pages and some links may be dead. There will eventually be pages explaining how to read these charts and the history of the work, but right now there's none of that. This site is not screen-reader-friendly; most of the information is contained in image files, and I don't know how else to do it. If you somehow found this site on your own and have constructive feedback, send it to milliliter (at) gmail (dot) com. 

Right now, the "website index" file contains an alphabetical list of Modern English words and links to their charts. Many of the charts span multiple pages, in which case the index links directly to the page that contains it, which may or may not link to its parent chart. Eventually they all will. If you change the numeral in the page's name to 0, you'll see the top-level page.
